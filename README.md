# Cancer Tumor Classifier

### Process:
* Performed exploratory data analysis with Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn
* Created a heatmap of correlations between variables to easily find strongly correlated variables
* Scaled and normalized tumor dataset after splitting into a training and test set
* Trained a deep learning model to perform binary classification 
* Significantly improved model performance as indicated by loss and validation losses by implementing Early Stopping and Dropout layers
